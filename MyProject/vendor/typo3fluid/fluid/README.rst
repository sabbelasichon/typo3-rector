======================
Fluid Rendering Engine
======================

Fluid is a PHP template engine and is the de facto standard for any HTML-based
output in the TYPO3 CMS ecosystem. However, it is not dependent on TYPO3 and can
be used in any PHP project.

General documentation of Fluid can be found in the Documentation/ folder, see
below link for a rendered version.
