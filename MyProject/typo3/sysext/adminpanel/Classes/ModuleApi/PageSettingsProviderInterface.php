 * Adminpanel page settings interface denotes that a module has settings regarding the page rendering.
 * The adminpanel knows two types of settings:
 * - ModuleSettings are relevant for the module itself and its representation (for example the log module provides settings
 *   where displayed log level and grouping of the module can be configured)
 * - PageSettings are relevant for rendering the page (for example the preview module provides settings showing or hiding
 *   hidden content elements or simulating a specific rendering time)
 * If a module provides settings changing the rendering of the main page request, use this interface.
