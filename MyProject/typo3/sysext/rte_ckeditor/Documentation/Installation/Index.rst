============
Installation
============

The system extension is part of common Composer distributions such as
`typo3/cms-base-distribution <https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/cms-base-distribution>`__.
It is activated by default and ships with a default configuration for editors.

If you don't use any distribution the system extension can be installed via:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require typo3/cms-rte-ckeditor

Legacy installations
====================

For legacy installations that do not use Composer, EXT:rte_ckeditor is already
part of the distributed package.

Activate the :guilabel:`RTE CKEditor` extension in :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Extension Manager`.
