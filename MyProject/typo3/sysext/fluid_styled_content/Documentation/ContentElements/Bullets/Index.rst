With this content element you can provide unordered and ordered bullet lists, but also a
definition list, in the frontend.


.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ContentElements/BulletsBackend.rst.txt

The type of list can be defined with the field :guilabel:`Type of bullets`.

The content is added in the field :guilabel:`Bullet List`, where each new line
is a new bullet.

.. code-block:: none

   Bullet 1
   Bullet 2
   Bullet 3

For definition lists you use one line for a single definition which starts with the term,
followed by the description, separated by a vertical bar "|".

.. code-block:: none

   Term 1|Description 1
   Term 2|Description 2
   Term 3|Description 3
