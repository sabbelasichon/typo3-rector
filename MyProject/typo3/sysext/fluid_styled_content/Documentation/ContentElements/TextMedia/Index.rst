=============
Text & Images
=============

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ContentOverview/TextMediaTypicalPageContent.rst.txt

This content element allows you to combine text and images. Additionally there
is also a content element for :guilabel:`Text & Media` where you can use videos
or Audio. There are also separate content elements for :guilabel:`Text`
or :guilabel:`Images` individually. These offer no advantage over the content element
:guilabel:`Text & Images` except that some fields are missing and the backend form
is less cluttered.

The text can be entered in the rich text editor of the :guilabel:`General`
tab.

The media elements can be added in the :guilabel:`Images` tab. In this tab
there is also the option to turn the *enlarge on click* behaviour on for images.

Multiple images and movies are combined as a gallery, which can be configured
using the :guilabel:`Gallery Settings`. In some installations there are
specific settings for width or height for each element, if a border
should be shown around each element, the position of the gallery in relation
to the text and the amount of columns which should be used for the gallery.

The maximum width of the gallery can be different when the gallery is on
top or bottom of the text, or inside the text. This can be set using the
:ref:`constant-editor`.
