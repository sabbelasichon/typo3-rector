What does it do?
----------------

The ``form`` extension acts as a flexible, extendible, yet easy to use form
framework. It equally allows editors, integrators, and developers to build
all types of forms. For this task, different interfaces and techniques are
available.

As a non-technical editor, you can use the "Forms" backend module. It
allows you to create and manage your individual forms with the help of a
nifty drag and drop interface. Your work can be previewed instantly.

As an experienced integrator, you are able to build ambitious forms which
are stored directly in your site package. Those forms can utilize hefty
finishers and ship localization files.

As a developer, you can use the PHP API to forge interfaces with conditional
form elements, register new validators and finishers, as well as create
custom form elements. Plenty of hooks allow you to manipulate the generation
and processing of the both form and data.
