1. Create a new form

   Go to the ``Forms`` module, and create a new form there. With the help of
   the form editor you can build appealing forms easily.

2. Insert your form on a page

   The next step is inserting the form on the desired page(s).

   #. Open the page module in the backend.
   #. Select the desired page.
   #. Create a new content element of type "Form". You can find this one
      under the tab "Form Elements".
   #. Under the tab "Plugin", choose the desired form.
   #. Save the content element.
   #. Repeat steps 2 to 5 until the form is inserted on every page you want.

You can now view your form on your web site. Enjoy!
