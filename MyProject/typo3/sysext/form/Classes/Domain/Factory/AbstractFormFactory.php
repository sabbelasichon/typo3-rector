 *
 * Example
 * =======
 *
 * Generally, you should use this class as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class MyFooBarFactory extends AbstractFormFactory {
 *   public function build(array $configuration, $prototypeName) {
 *     $configurationService = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(ConfigurationService::class);
 *     $prototypeConfiguration = $configurationService->getPrototypeConfiguration($prototypeName);
 *     $formDefinition = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(FormDefinition::class, 'nameOfMyForm', $prototypeConfiguration);
 *
 *     // now, you should call methods on $formDefinition to add pages and form elements
 *
 *     return $formDefinition;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Scope: frontend / backend
 * **This class is meant to be sub classed by developers.**
