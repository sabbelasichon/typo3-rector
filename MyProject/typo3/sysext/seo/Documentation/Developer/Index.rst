When you work with a pages-only approach you most likely don't need to use the meta tag APIs. If you have a special
edge-case or have a detail view to show a record, you need the APIs to render the corresponding meta information for your
page. You can refer to the documentation of the following APIs:

- The MetaTagApi (see :ref:`t3coreapi:metatagapi`) to define what metatags should be rendered on your page
- The PageTitleAPI (see :ref:`t3coreapi:pagetitle`) will give you the possibility to set the title of the page
