 * Interface PreviewRendererInterface

 * Contract for classes capable of rendering previews of a given record
 * from a table. Responsible for rendering preview header, preview content
 * and wrapping of those two values.
 *
 * Responsibilities are segmented into three methods, one for each responsibility,
 * which is done in order to allow overriding classes to change those parts
 * individually without having to replace other parts. Rather than relying on
 * implementations to be friendly and divide code into smaller pieces and
 * give them (at least) protected visibility, the key methods are instead required
 * on the interface directly.
 *
 * Callers are then responsible for calling each method and combining/wrapping
 * the output appropriately.
