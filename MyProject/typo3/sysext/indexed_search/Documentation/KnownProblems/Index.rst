Known problems
--------------

- Currently the extension is under observation because instances of
  heavy server load/unstability has been reported. It is not yet clear
  if THIS extension has anything to do with. So it's only under
  suspicion at this point until further data has been collected. But for
  now it is advised to be careful with the application of the extension
  for mission critical, high-load environments.

- It's still uncertain how performance is under heavy load conditions
  and when MANY pages are indexed. Currently benchmarks have been done
  only up to 2000 pages indexed/approx. 400.000 relation records. It is
  likely that some parts have to be optimized for such scenarios.
