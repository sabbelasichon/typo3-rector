    Identify any extensions that are modifying the Table Control Array (TCA) in ext_tables.php.
    Changes made to the TCA in ext_tables.php can result in performance drawbacks.
</p>
<p>
    Since TYPO3 CMS 6.2 changes to $GLOBALS['TCA']
    must be stored inside a folder called Configuration/TCA/Overrides with one file per modified table.
    <br>
    These files are named along the pattern &lt;tablename&gt;.php.
</p>
<p>
    Thus if you want to customize the TCA of tx_foo_domain_model_bar,
    youâ€™d create the file Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tx_foo_domain_model_bar.php.
</p>
<p>
    The advantage of this method is that all such changes are incorporated into
    $GLOBALS['TCA'] before it is cached. This is thus far more efficient.
