This directory contains all packaged third-party frontend libraries needed
for the TYPO3 CMS Core. They are mostly managed via Grunt or have been adapted
to fit our needs.

Please make sure to never reference any file directly here, rather copy
a file needed in your own extension or reference it via JavaScript import
statments instead of using the Path to this Contrib/ directory.

Libraries not handled by bower/Grunt:

- bootstrap/bootstrap.js
Twitter Bootstrap 3 is not shipped as an AMD module, and has been adapted to be
wrapped as an AMD module called "bootstrap".
