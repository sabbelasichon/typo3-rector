===============================
Deprecation: #89033 - jumpToUrl
===============================

See :issue:`89033`

Description
===========

The JavaScript function :js:`jumpToUrl()` which is widely used in TYPO3 has been marked as deprecated.


Impact
======

Calling :js:`jumpToUrl()` will cause a deprecation entry in the browser's console.


Affected Installations
======================

Extensions using :js:`jumpToUrl()` implementation are affected.


Migration
=========

Since :js:`jumpToUrl()` triggers a redirect only, it's safe to either use :js:`window.location.href = 'link/to/my/module';`
or use the link in combination with plain HTML as in :html:`<a href="link/to/my/module">my link</a>`.
