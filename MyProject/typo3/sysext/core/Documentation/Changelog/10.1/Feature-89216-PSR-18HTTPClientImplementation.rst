Feature: #89216 - PSR-18 HTTP Client Implementation
===================================================

See :issue:`89216`

Description
===========

Support for PSR-18_ HTTP Client has been added.

PSR-18 HTTP Client is intended to be used by PSR-15_ request handlers in order to perform HTTP
requests based on PSR-7_ message objects without relying on a specific HTTP client implementation.

PSR-18 consists of a client interfaces and three exception interfaces:

- :php:`\Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface`
- :php:`\Psr\Http\Client\ClientExceptionInterface`
- :php:`\Psr\Http\Client\NetworkExceptionInterface`
- :php:`\Psr\Http\Client\RequestExceptionInterface`

Request handlers shall use dependency injection to retrieve the concrete implementation
of the PSR-18 HTTP client interface :php:`\Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface`.


Impact
======

The PSR-18 HTTP Client interface is provided by `psr/http-client` and may be used as
dependency for services in order to perform HTTP requests using PSR-7 request objects.
PSR-7 request objects can be created with the PSR-17_ Request Factory interface.

Note: This does not replace the currently available Guzzle wrapper
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Http\RequestFactory->request()`, but is available as a framework
agnostic, more generic alternative. The PSR-18 interface does not allow to pass request
specific guzzle options. But global options defined in :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP']`
are taken into account as GuzzleHTTP is used as backend for this PSR-18 implementation.
The concrete implementations is internal and will be replaced by a native guzzle PSR-18
implementation once it is available.

Example usage
-------------

A middleware might need to request an external service in order to transform the response
into a new response. The PSR-18 HTTP client interface is used to perform the external
HTTP request. The PSR-17 Request Factory Interface is used to create the HTTP request that
the PSR-18 HTTP Client expects. The PSR-7 Response Factory is then used to create a new
response to be returned to the user. All off these interface implementations are injected
as constructor dependencies:
