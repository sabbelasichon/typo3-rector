==========================================
Breaking: #79242 - Remove l10n_mode noCopy
==========================================

See :issue:`79242`

Description
===========

The setting `noCopy` has been removed without replacement from the list of possible values of the TCA column
property `l10n_mode`.


Impact
======

Previously `noCopy` prevented that values of the parent language record were copied
to a particular localization when that was created. Now, this value is duplicated during the creation of the localized record and has to be cleared manually if required.


Affected Installations
======================

All having :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA'][<table-name>]['columns'][<column-name>]['l10n_mode']`
set to `noCopy`.


Migration
=========

Remove setting :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA'][<table-name>]['columns'][<column-name>]['l10n_mode']`
if it is set to `noCopy`.
