===================================================
Feature: #28171 - Improved link field in FormEngine
===================================================

See :issue:`28171`

Description
===========

The handling of link fields when managing records has been improved and now shows a human readable string,
an icon and an additional help text instead of the cryptic :code:`t3://` syntax. This is enabled
by default for all :code:`renderType="inputLink"` elements.


Impact
======

Better UX of link fields in the Backend
