Important: #82794 - Added config.sys_language_mode = content_fallback;3,2,pageNotFound
======================================================================================

See :issue:`82794`

Description
===========

If a translation (language UID 5) has a TypoScript configuration to
:typoscript:`config.sys_language_mode = content_fallback;3,2` the definition is that if this page is not
available in this translation (language = 5) then check if a translation for `3` and after that `2` is
set.

However, if none of the page translations is available, the fallback to `0` always applies.

On a set up like:

* language = 0 is german
* language = 2 is english-worldwide
* language = 3 is english-US
* language = 5 is russian

You would not want to fall back to german AT ALL.

It is now possible to define a special keyword called `pageNotFound` to not fall back to
:typoscript:`sys_language_uid = 0` if any other fallbacks do not work - so a 404 error page is thrown.
:typoscript:`config.sys_language_mode = content_fallback;3,2,pageNotFound`
