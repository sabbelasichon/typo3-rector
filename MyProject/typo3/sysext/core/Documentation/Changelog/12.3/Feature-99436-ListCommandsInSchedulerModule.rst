===================================================
Feature: #99436 - List commands in scheduler module
===================================================

See :issue:`99436`

Description
===========

Commands based on Symfony commands are the successor of regular tasks since TYPO3 v8.

The scheduler submodule :guilabel:`Available scheduler commands & tasks` has been extended
to list not only available scheduler tasks, but CLI commands that can be added
as scheduler tasks.


Impact
======

The submodule :guilabel:`Available scheduler commands & tasks` has been improved to
list schedulable commands as well. This improves the overview and makes it easier
to set up commands.
