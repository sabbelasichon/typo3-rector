Feature: #100093 - Show path to record location in group elements
=================================================================

See :issue:`100093`

Description
===========

To ease the usage of `group` fields in the FormEngine, for example, like in the
"Insert records" content element, the record overview now shows the path to the
location where each assigned record is stored, respectively.


Impact
======

Elements of type `group` now show the path to the page where any assigned record
is stored in.
