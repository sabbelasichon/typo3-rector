=======================================================================
Feature: #100027 - Copy files and folders within the File > List module
=======================================================================

See :issue:`100027`

Description
===========

With TYPO3 v12.2, the feature to
:ref:`drag+drop files and folders <feature-99733-1675025218>` between the tree
structure was added. Now it is also possible to copy or move resources within
the actual file listing (tile view or list view), for example, into a different subfolder
by selecting them, and using the mouse to drop them on to a target folder.

Impact
======

The :guilabel:`File > List` module is now fully usable with drag+drop between
the tree and within the listing itself.

All features make it easier for editors to manage and organize the digital
assets used within TYPO3.
