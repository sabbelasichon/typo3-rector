Feature: #52286 - Add option to "system status updates" report-job to send all tests
====================================================================================

See :issue:`52286`

Description
===========

Sometimes it is useful to also get every test in the "System Status Updates (reports)" via email.

A checkbox was added to the job configuration for the decision to get a mail only if the
system has WARNING or ERROR events, or just get a mail for everything.
If the checkbox is not set (default) it works like before, including WARNING and ERROR events only.


Impact
======

If the checkbox `Notification for all type of status, not only warning and error` is checked,
then the `System Status Update (reports)` contains all type of notifications.
