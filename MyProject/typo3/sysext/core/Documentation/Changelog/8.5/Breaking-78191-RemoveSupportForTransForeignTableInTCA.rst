==============================================================
Breaking: #78191 - Remove support for transForeignTable in TCA
==============================================================

See :issue:`78191`

Description
===========

TCA allowed the definition of separate tables to hold localized and translated records.
The property names used for that were `transForeignTable` (basically pointed to
table `pages_language_overlay`) and `transOrigPointerTable` (basically
pointed back to table `pages`). The mentioned two pages tables are the only
tables that make use of this feature in the TYPO3 core.

To overcome special handling and to combine `pages_language_overlay` with
`pages` at a later step, the configured table names have been replaced with
hardcoded table names.


Impact
======

Modifications concerning the following two TCA control properties won't have
any effect anymore:

* :php:`$GLOBALS[TCA][<tableName>]['ctrl']['transForeignTable']`
* :php:`$GLOBALS[TCA][<tableName>]['ctrl']['transOrigPointerTable']`


Affected Installations
======================

All sites using localizations and translations for page hierarchies.


Migration
=========

No special actions are required if just the core defaults are used. Special
adjustments concerning the mentioned TCA properties should be verified and
hard-coded for the time being.

* :php:`$GLOBALS[TCA]['pages']['ctrl']['transForeignTable']`, use value `pages_language_overlay` directly
* :php:`$GLOBALS[TCA]['pages_language_overlay']['ctrl']['transOrigPointerTable']`, use value `pages` directly
