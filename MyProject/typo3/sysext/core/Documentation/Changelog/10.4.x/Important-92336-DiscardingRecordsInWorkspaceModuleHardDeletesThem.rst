Important: #92336 - Discarding records in workspace module hard deletes them
============================================================================

See :issue:`92336`

Description
===========

The discard functionality in the workspace module allows to "throw away"
changes that have been done by editors in a workspace.

On database side, discard previously created a mixture of hard deleted (dropped)
rows and soft deleted (field :sql:`deleted` set to :sql:`1`) rows.

This has been streamlined: Discarding records now always hard deletes rows from
the database. Those records can't be "undeleted" using the recycler extension
anymore, which only worked in very simple and limited cases before.
