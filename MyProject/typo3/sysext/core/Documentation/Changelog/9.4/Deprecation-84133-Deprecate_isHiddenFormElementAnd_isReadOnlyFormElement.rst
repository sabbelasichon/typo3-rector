See :issue:`84133`

Description
===========

The following properties have been marked as deprecated and should not be used any longer:

Those properties are available for the following form elements of the form framework:

* ContentElement
* Hidden
* Honeypot


Impact
======

The properties mentioned are still available in TYPO3 v9, but they will be dropped in TYPO3 v10.


Affected Installations

Any form built with the form framework is affected as soon as those properties have been manually
added to the form definition.


Migration
=========

Usages of the above mentioned properties should be switched to the variants feature instead.
