============================================
Feature: #90826 - Compare backend usergroups
============================================

See :issue:`90826`

Description
===========

Integrators are now able to compare individual backend usergroups.

Backend usergroups are used to split permissions into smaller parts which can be later assigned to a backend user.
This feature makes it possible to compare the defined permissions including the ones inherited from sub groups.
