=====================================
Deprecation: #90686 - Model FileMount
=====================================

See :issue:`90686`

Description
===========

The class :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Domain\Model\FileMount` has been marked as deprecated.

The :php:`FileMount` is an internal class which never really had any functionality
besides being an Extbase model for the database table :sql:`sys_filemounts`. Therefore
and in order to streamline the codebase of Extbase, the class :php:`FileMount` will be removed with TYPO3 11.0.


Impact
======

Using :php:`FileMount` will trigger a PHP :php:`E_USER_DEPRECATED` error.


Affected Installations
======================

Any TYPO3 installation with a third-party extension using the model.


Migration
=========

Copy the class and mapping to your own extension and adopt the usages.
