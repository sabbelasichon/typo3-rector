=================================================================================================================
Deprecation: #69754 - Deprecate relative path to extension directory and using filename only in TCA ctrl iconfile
=================================================================================================================

See :issue:`69754`

Description
===========

* Using relative paths to refer to the extension directory for iconfiles in `TCA['ctrl']['iconfile']` has been marked as deprecated.
* Using filenames only to refer to an iconfile in TCA['ctrl'] has been marked as deprecated.


Impact
======

* TCA definitions in `TCA['ctrl']['iconfile']` containing `'../typo3conf/ext/'` or calls to `\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::extRelPath()` will trigger a deprecation log entry.
* TCA definitions in `TCA['ctrl']['iconfile']` containing a filename only will trigger a deprecation log entry.


Affected Installations
======================

Any installation with extensions defining `TCA['ctrl']['iconfile']` by using `../typo3conf/ext/` or only a filename.


Migration
=========

Relative paths
--------------

Use `EXT:` instead of relative path `'../typo3conf/ext/'` or `\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::extRelPath()`, e.g.

.. code-block:: php

	'ctrl' => array(
		'iconfile' => \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::extRelPath('my_extension') . 'Resources/Public/Icons/image.png'
	),

has to be migrated to

.. code-block:: php

	'ctrl' => array(
		'iconfile' => 'EXT:my_extension/Resources/Public/Icons/image.png'
	),

Filename only
-------------

Use a full absolute path or an `EXT:` definition instead of a filename only:

.. code-block:: php

	'ctrl' => array(
		'iconfile' => '_icon_ftp.gif'
	),

has to be migrated to

.. code-block:: php

	'ctrl' => array(
		'iconfile' => 'EXT:t3skin/icons/gfx/i/_icon_ftp.gif'
	),

or

.. code-block:: php

	'ctrl' => array(
		// You can use absolute paths (to your web root folder) to the icons but
		// it is discouraged to do so as these icons belong to an extension they
		// should also be stored in this extension
		'iconfile' => '/fileadmin/icons/_icon_ftp.gif'
	),
