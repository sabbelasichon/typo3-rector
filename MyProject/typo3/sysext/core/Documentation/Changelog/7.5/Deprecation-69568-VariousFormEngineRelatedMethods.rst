========================================================
Deprecation: #69568 - Various FormEngine related methods
========================================================

See :issue:`69568`

Description
===========

The following methods have been marked as deprecated and should not no longer be used:

* `BackendUtility::getExcludeFields()`
* `BackendUtility::getExplicitAuthFieldValues()`
* `BackendUtility::getSystemLanguages()`
* `BackendUtility::getRegisteredFlexForms()`
* `BackendUtility::exec_foreign_table_where_query()`
* `BackendUtility::replaceMarkersInWhereClause()`


Impact
======

Using those methods will trigger a deprecation log entry.


Affected Installations
======================

The impact is rather low in general since those methods were mostly internal in
the first place and only used within FormEngine scope. It is unlikely extensions
are affected by this change.


Migration
=========

If still used, extensions should switch to own solutions for those methods.
