Feature: #84780 - Store icons fetched by the Icon API in localStorage
=====================================================================

See :issue:`84780`

Description
===========

Icons that get fetched by the JavaScript-based Icon API are now stored in the localStorage of the client.
A hash is calculated based on the state of the IconRegistry and stored in the localStorage as well to determine whether
the icon markup needs to get refetched from the server.
