===========================================================================
Deprecation: #84295 - Use ServerRequestInterface in File/EditFileController
===========================================================================

See :issue:`84295`


Description
===========

A series of class properties has been set to protected.
They will throw deprecation warnings if called public from outside:

* :php:`$origTarget`
* :php:`$target`
* :php:`$doc`
* [not scanned] :php:`$returnUrl`
* [not scanned] :php:`$content`
* [not scanned] :php:`$title`

All methods not used as entry points by :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Http\RouteDispatcher` will be
removed or set to protected in v10 and throw deprecation warnings if used from a third party:

* [not scanned] :php:`main()`
* :php: `getButtons()`

Impact
======

Calling one of the above methods or accessing one of the above properties on an instance of
:php:`FileEditController` will throw a deprecation warning in v9 and a PHP fatal in v10.


Affected Installations
======================

The extension scanner will find most usages, but may also find some false positives. The most
common property and method names like :php:`$title` are not registered and will not be found
if an extension uses that on an instance of :php:`FileEditController`. In general all extensions
that set properties or call methods except :php:`mainAction()` are affected.


Migration
=========

In general, extensions should not instantiate and re-use controllers of the core. Existing
usages should be rewritten to be free of calls like these.
