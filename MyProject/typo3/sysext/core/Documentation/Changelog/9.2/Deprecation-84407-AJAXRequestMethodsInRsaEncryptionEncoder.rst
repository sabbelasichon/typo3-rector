==================================================================
Deprecation: #84407 - AJAX request methods in RsaEncryptionEncoder
==================================================================

See :issue:`84407`

Description
===========

All methods related to AJAX requests in :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Rsaauth\RsaEncryptionEncoder` have been marked as deprecated:

* :php:`getRsaPublicKeyAjaxHandler()`

The `rsa_publickey` AJAX route has been adapted to use the
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Rsaauth\Controller\RsaPublicKeyGenerationController` which was already used for RSA key retrieval via
eID in the frontend.


Impact
======

Calling the above method on an instance of :php:`RsaEncryptionEncoder` will throw a deprecation warning in v9 and a
PHP fatal in v10.


Affected Installations
======================

All extensions that call the deprecated method are affected.


Migration
=========

Extensions should use the AJAX route `rsa_publickey` instead of the deprecated method.
