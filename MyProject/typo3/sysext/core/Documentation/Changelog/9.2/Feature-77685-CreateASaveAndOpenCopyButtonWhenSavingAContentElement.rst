Feature: #77685 - Create a save and open copy button when saving a content element
==================================================================================

See :issue:`77685`

Description
===========

Editors can no clone a new record by using the new button "clone" in the edit record form for already persisted records.
If there are not persisted changes when pressing the button a modal appears, providing the following 3 options:

* abort
* clone the content element without saving the current changes
* save the changes and clones the record afterwards.

The copy of the record will by put right below the record itself.
After saving, the edit record form opens for the cloned element.


Impact
======

Editors are able to make a duplicate of a record with just a single click. They don't have to copy & paste.
