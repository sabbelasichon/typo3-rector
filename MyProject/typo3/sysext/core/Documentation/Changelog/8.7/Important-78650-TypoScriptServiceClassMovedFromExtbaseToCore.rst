======================================================================
Important: #78650 - TypoScriptService class moved from Extbase to Core
======================================================================

See :issue:`78650`

Description
===========

The PHP class :php:`TypoScriptService` has been moved to the core extension, as it has no direct link
to Extbase, and a lot of other system extensions are using the class.

The old class name :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Service\TypoScriptService` is registered as a class alias
for the new class name :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\TypoScript\TypoScriptService`, so extensions can call the
class via the Extbase PHP namespace in TYPO3 v8 without any downsides.
