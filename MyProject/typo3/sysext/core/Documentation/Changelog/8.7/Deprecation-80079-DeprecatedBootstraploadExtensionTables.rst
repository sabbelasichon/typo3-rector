======================================================================
Deprecation: #80079 - Deprecated method Bootstrap::loadExtensionTables
======================================================================

See :issue:`80079`

Description
===========

The internal method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\Bootstrap::loadExtensionTables()` has been deprecated and should not be used any longer.


Impact
======

Calling the deprecated :php:`Bootstrap::loadExtensionTables()` method will trigger a deprecation log entry.


Affected Installations
======================

Any installation using the mentioned method :php:`Bootstrap::loadExtensionTables()`.
Please note that this method is marked as internal and should not be called at all from outside the TYPO3 core.


Migration
=========

If you need to call the internal Bootstrap method, you can use :php:`Bootstrap::loadBaseTca()` and :php:`Bootstrap::loadExtTables()` now.
Please note that both methods are marked as internal and don't belong to public TYPO3 core API.
This means that the methods can be adjusted anytime by the core itself.
