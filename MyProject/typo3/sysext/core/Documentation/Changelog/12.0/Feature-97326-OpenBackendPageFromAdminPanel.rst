====================================================
Feature: #97326 - Open backend page from admin panel
====================================================

See :issue:`97326`

Description
===========

In previous versions with EXT:feedit the admin panel had a button to directly
open the currently viewed page in the backend. Since we have backend routing
available, we can implement a similar feature directly in the admin panel.
This will not replace the complete functionality of `feedit`, but it gives editors
a possibility to navigate via the frontend and directly open the backend with a
single click.

Impact
======

The admin panel has a direct link to the corresponding backend page.
