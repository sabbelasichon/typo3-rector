==========================================================
Feature: #97347 - Allow keyboard navigation in live search
==========================================================

See :issue:`97347`

Description
===========

It is now possible to select results in the live search
using the arrow keys up/down and enter/tab to open the
selected result. On top, the input field stays focused after
a record is selected, allowing a user to quickly search and open any
record from the result list without using the mouse.

Previously, it was not possible to use the keyboard to navigate
through the search results of the live search.
