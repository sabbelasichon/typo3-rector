=============================================================
Feature: #99552 - Introduce "Missing Meta Description" widget
=============================================================

See :issue:`99552`

Description
===========

To make it more convenient for TYPO3 users to optimise their website for search
engines, TYPO3 now offers a dashboard widget that shows pages without
a meta description.


Impact
======

TYPO3 users who have access to the :guilabel:`Dashboard` module and are
granted access to the new widget can now add and use the widget.
The users will only see pages with missing meta description they are
allowed to edit.
