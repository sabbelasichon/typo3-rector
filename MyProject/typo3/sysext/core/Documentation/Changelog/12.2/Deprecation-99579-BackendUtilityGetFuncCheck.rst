====================================================
Deprecation: #99579 - BackendUtility::getFuncCheck()
====================================================

See :issue:`99579`

Description
===========

The method :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Utility\BackendUtility::getFuncCheck()` has
been marked as deprecated and should not be used any longer.


Impact
======

Calling the method will raise a deprecation level log error and will
stop working with TYPO3 v13.


Affected installations
======================

The method may be used in extensions that add backend modules. The
extension scanner finds usages with a strong match.


Migration
=========

:php:`BackendUtility::getFuncCheck()` is a helper method that renders a
select dropdown and is typically used to trigger a `GET` request when
the user selects an option.

In general, such HTML should not be generated by PHP, but by Fluid templating.
The method is thus typically used by old school backend modules that have not
or only partially been transferred to Fluid, improving the controller-view
separation.

The most simple and ugly migration is to copy the method to an own controller
that consumes the method. The better solution is to add the arguments as variables
to the Fluid template and render the dropdown in Fluid. This should be a pretty
straight transition as well and typically avoids another :html:`<f:format.raw>`
ViewHelper usage.

Note that requests send by these drop-downs should switch from `GET` to `POST` in
case they change the server state (e. g. changing records) along the way: State changing
requests should be restricted to POST as an additional security measure, and to
not violate the HTTP protocol. The TYPO3 Core comes with more and more examples
on how to handle this properly. For instance, all dropdowns and checkbox toggles
of the `tstemplate` extension (:guilabel:`Site Management > TypoScript` backend module)
have been changed to do this and can be studied on how to trigger immediate
`POST` actions when clicking such elements.
