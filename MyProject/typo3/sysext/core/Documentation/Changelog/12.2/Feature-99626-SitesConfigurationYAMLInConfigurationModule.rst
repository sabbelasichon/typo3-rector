====================================================================
Feature: #99626 - Sites configuration (YAML) in configuration module
====================================================================

See :issue:`99626`

Description
===========

Currently, it is difficult to have a global overview of the YAML configuration
of sites (especially the route enhancers). Since those configurations are basic
information, it is important for site administrators to have an overview of them.

Therefore, the configuration module now lists all site configurations
with their identifier and corresponding configuration.

Impact
======

It is now possible for site administrators to get an overview of the YAML
configuration of all sites in the configuration module.
