====================================================================
Feature: #99733 - Drag + Drop between different folders in file list
====================================================================

See :issue:`99733`

Description
===========

When working with files in the :guilabel:`File > Filelist` module, editors can
now select one or multiple files or folders, and move them to a different
location within the folder tree on the navigation area via drag and drop.

Impact
======

TYPO3 editors no longer need to use the clipboard functionality to move files,
as drag and drop support is included natively. It acts similar to
what editors know from their operating system functionality.
