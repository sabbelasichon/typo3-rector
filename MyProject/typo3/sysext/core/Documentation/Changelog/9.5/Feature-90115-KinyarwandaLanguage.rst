Feature: #90115 - Add support for Kinyarwanda language
======================================================

See :issue:`90115`

Description
===========

Kinyarwanda - the Rwanda official language is now available to use in TYPO3 system-wide for
translation labels, giving full support for having a TYPO3 installation (Frontend and Backend)
working with Kinyarwanda out-of-the-box.

The ISO-639-1 language code "rw" is now added to TYPO3's default locales.

Impact
======

Kinyarwanda will be shown on the "Manage Language Packs" modal and also possible to select
in BE user preferences. It is possible to use the "kw" ISO-639-1 iso code in site languages
to use the labels in TYPO3 Frontend.
