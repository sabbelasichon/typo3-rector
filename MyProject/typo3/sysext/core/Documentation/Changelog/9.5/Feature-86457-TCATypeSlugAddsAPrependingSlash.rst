=======================================================
Feature: #86457 - TCA Type Slug adds a prepending slash
=======================================================

See :issue:`86457`

Description
===========

The new TCA type slug field now hard-codes a slash as a prefix for all pages, as this is
mandatory for URL resolving and ensuring a uniqueness within a site.

However, for slug types within regular records, it is not necessary to do so, therefore the slash
is never prepended on a "regular" slug field.

If - in some special cases - the "slug" field should contain a slash (due to e.g. nested categories
with human readable url path segments), a new option `prependSlash` is added to TCA type slug.


Impact
======

Third-party extensions using the slug field now receive a slug value without a slash, and
can use this as a regular - sanitized - slug field. It is however recommended to use the
`uniqueInPid` eval option to ensure uniqueness.

If a nested record structure is given, it is recommended to use the new option :php:`prependSlash`
by setting it to :php:`true`.
