==================================================
Feature: #86422 - TypoScript getText property site
==================================================

See :issue:`86422`

Description
===========

Site configuration can now be accessed via the :typoscript:`getText` property in TypoScript.

Example:

.. code-block:: typoscript

    page.10 = TEXT
    page.10.data = site:base
    page.10.wrap = This is your base URL: |

Where :typoscript:`site` is the keyword for accessing an aspect, and the following parts are the configuration key(s) to access.

.. code-block:: typoscript

    data = site:customConfigKey.nested.value

Impact
======

Accessing site configuration is now possible in TypoScript, which enables to store site specific configuration options
in one central place and allows usage of that configuration from different contexts. While this sounds similar to using
TypoScript, with using site configuration this may also be used from backend or CLI context as long as the rootPageId
of the site is known. To avoid duplicating configuration options, TypoScript can now access these properties, too.
