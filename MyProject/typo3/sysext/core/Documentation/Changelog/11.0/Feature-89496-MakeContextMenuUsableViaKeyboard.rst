======================================================

See :issue:`89496`

in order to navigate through the menu. Besides that, using enter and
space keys will active items or open submenus.

This change follows the best practices as described in WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1,
see the `W3 document`_ for further reading.

as advised in WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1. Screen readers are now
able to recognize the context menu properly.
