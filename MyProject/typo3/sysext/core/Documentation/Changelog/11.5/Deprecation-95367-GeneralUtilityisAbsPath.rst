=================================================
Deprecation: #95367 - GeneralUtility::isAbsPath()
=================================================

See :issue:`95367`

Description
===========

The low-level TYPO3 API method
:php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::isAbsPath()`
has been marked as deprecated.


Impact
======

Calling the method in your own PHP code will trigger a PHP :php:`E_USER_DEPRECATED` error.


Affected Installations
======================

TYPO3 installations with custom extensions calling this PHP
method are affected. You can check if you are affected via the Extension
Scanner tool provided in the Install Tool.


Migration
=========

Replace any calls to :php:`GeneralUtility::isAbsPath()` with
the exact equivalent :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\PathUtility::isAbsolutePath()`
which checks for the same input.
