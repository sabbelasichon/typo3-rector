================================================================
Deprecation: #95343 - Legacy hook for new content element wizard
================================================================

See :issue:`95343`

Description
===========

The hook :php:`$GLOBALS['TBE_MODULES_EXT']['xMOD_db_new_content_el']['addElClasses']`
which has been used primarily back in TYPO3 v4.x times with the extension
kickstarter for pi-based plugins has been marked as deprecated.


Impact
======

When an extension is registering a hook, and the
:guilabel:`Create new content element` wizard is called, a PHP :php:`E_USER_DEPRECATED` error is triggered.


Affected installations
======================

TYPO3 installations with third-party extensions using this hook.


Migration
=========

The alternative hook
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['cms']['db_new_content_el']['wizardItemsHook']`
can be used instead, which allows to modify and add wizard items
as well.
