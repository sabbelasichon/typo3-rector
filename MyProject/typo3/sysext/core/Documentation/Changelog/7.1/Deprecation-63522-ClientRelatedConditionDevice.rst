=================================================================
Deprecation: #63522 - Deprecate the "device" TypoScript condition
=================================================================

See :issue:`63522`

Description
===========

Client related TypoScript conditions the `device` type condition have been marked as deprecated.

Impact
======

Using a condition like `[device = wap]` is considered outdated and should be solved differently.

Affected installations
======================

Instances with TypoScript that rely on `[device = ...]`.

Migration
=========

* Most usual conditions for specific browsers can nowadays be turned into conditional CSS includes
* Use libraries such as modernizr for browser support
* If conditions for specific clients or devices are still needed, they
  should be done with a userFunc condition and a project like WURFL
  that keep the device information more recent than the current core
  code like matching AMIGA
