====================================================================
Breaking: #63687 - Outdated ContentObjects moved to legacy extension
====================================================================

See :issue:`63687`

Description
===========

The TypoScript Content Objects (cObjects) CLEARGIF, COLUMNS, CTABLE, OTABLE and HRULER have been moved into the legacy extension
EXT:compatibility6.

Impact
======

Any TypoScript using the cObjects above will result in an empty output in the TYPO3 Frontend.


Affected installations
======================

TYPO3 CMS 7 installations still using the cObjects need EXT:compatibility6 to be loaded if the rendering should
be continued.

Migration
=========

Any installation should migrate to alternatives such as FLUIDTEMPLATE to customize the output of the content.
