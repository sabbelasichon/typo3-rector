==============================================================
Breaking: #72464 - Removed deprecated code from EXT:workspaces
==============================================================

See :issue:`72464`

Description
===========

The following components have been changed during the development of TYPO3 CMS 7
and lead to deprecated code which is removed in TYPO3 CMS 8.

* remove rewritten toolbar item (:issue:`62800`)
* remove rewritten notification parts (:issue:`35245`)


Impact
======

Using or extending :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Workspaces\ExtDirect\ToolbarMenu` will fail since
it has been removed.

Using :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Workspaces\Service\StagesService::getNotificationMode($stageId)`
will fail.

Relying on the following database fields in the tables sys_workspace and
sys_workspace_stage will fail:

* sys_workspace.edit_notification_mode
* sys_workspace.publish_notification_mode
* sys_workspace.execute_notification_mode
* sys_workspace_stage.notification_mode


Affected Installations
======================

All installations using workspaces and notifications that have not been migrated
to TYPO3 CMS 7, yet.


Migration
=========

First migrate to TYPO3 CMS 7 and use the accordant upgrade wizard
(WorkspacesNotificationSettingsUpdate) and then upgrade to TYPO3 CMS 8.
