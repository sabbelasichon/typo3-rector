Feature: #74179 - Page Module Drag & Drop Can Do Copies Via CTRL Key Now
========================================================================

See :issue:`74179`

Description
===========

Additionally to the usual drag  and drop in the page module, that was able to move
content elements from position A to B, you can do copies via drag & drop now. Just
press the CTRL-key while dropping to create a copy of the dragged element at the drop
zone position. After dropping is finished the page module will reload to make sure
the new element will be generated with all necessary information.
