Breaking: #43085 - Change GFX settings prefix im\_* to generic processor\_*
===========================================================================

See :issue:`43085`

Description
===========

Graphics processor settings for Image- or GraphicsMagick have been renamed
in `LocalConfiguration.php`. The former prefix `im\_` has been replaced with
the unified prefix `processor\_`.

Negative namings like `noScaleUp` have been changed positive counterparts.
During the conversion the previous configuration values are negated to reflect
the changes in semantics of these options.

In addition references to specific versions of ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick
have been removed from settings names and values. For a detailed list of
changes please consult the information in the migration section.

The unused configuration option `image\_processing` has been removed without
replacement.

The processor specific configuration option `colorspace` has been namespaced
below the `processor\_` hierarchy.


Impact
======

Existing settings in `LocalConfiguration.php` are automatically migrated
through a silent upgrader when entering the Install Tool. If you modify
the settings in `AdditionalConfiguration.php` or rely on them inside an
extension you need to update those.


Affected Installations
======================

Installations which modify those settings directly or access them.


Migration
=========

The following table lists the changed configuration keys and the appropriate
values if these have changed.
