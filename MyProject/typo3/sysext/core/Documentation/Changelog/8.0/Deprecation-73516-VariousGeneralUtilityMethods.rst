Description
===========

The following methods within GeneralUtility have been marked as deprecated:

The second and third parameter of `GeneralUtility::getFileAbsFileName()` have been removed as well.

with the second and third parameter set will also trigger a deprecation log entry.


Affected Installations
======================

Any installation using any third-party extension calling any of these methods.


Migration
=========

For `GeneralUtility::flushOutputBuffers()` use `ob_clean()`.

For `GeneralUtility::imageMagickCommand()` use `CommandUtility::imageMagickCommand`.
