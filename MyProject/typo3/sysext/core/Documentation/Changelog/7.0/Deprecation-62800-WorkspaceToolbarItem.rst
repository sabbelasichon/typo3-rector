==========================================================
Deprecation: #62800 - Workspaces ToolbarItem via ExtDirect
==========================================================

See :issue:`62800`

Description
===========

The PHP functionality for switching a workspace was done with the ExtDirect call :code:`TYPO3.Ajax.ExtDirect.ToolbarMenu`
until now. This has been replaced by a simple AJAX JSON call, based on jQuery and the refactored ToolbarItem Menu for
the workspaces module.

Impact
======

The core does not use this functionality anymore, and also removed the ExtDirect registration for this class.


Affected installations
======================

All installations which directly used the ExtDirect :code:`TYPO3.Ajax.ExtDirect.ToolbarMenu` to fetch the data.

Migration
=========

Use the new AjaxHandler :code:`Workspaces::setWorkspace()` directly instead.
