==================================================================================
Deprecation: #62893 - Flashmessage JavaScript object TYPO3.Flashmessages was moved
==================================================================================

See :issue:`62893`

Description
===========

Flashmessages JavaScript object has been moved from `TYPO3.Flashmessages` to `top.TYPO3.Flashmessages`.
The severity constant values has been changed to correspond to the same values (-2,-1,0,1,2) of the constants as in PHP.
The constants `TYPO3.Severity.information` have been marked as deprecated.
3rd party extensions referring to `TYPO3.Severity.information` will work until CMS 9.
A compatibility file was introduced to map `TYPO3.Flashmessages` to `top.TYPO3.Flashmessages`, will also work until CMS 9.


Impact
======

If a 3rd party extension calls the mentioned methods directly, a deprecation log will be written to the browser console.


Affected installations
======================

A TYPO3 instance is affected if a 3rd party extension refers to the method `TYPO3.Flashmessages.display()` or uses `TYPO3.Severity.information` constants.


Migration
=========

The affected 3rd party extensions must be modified to use `top.TYPO3.Flashmessages` instead of `TYPO3.Flashmessages`.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Old and deprecated:
    TYPO3.Flashmessages.display(TYPO3.Severity.notice)

    // New and the only correct way:
    top.TYPO3.Flashmessages.display(top.TYPO3.Severity.notice)

The `TYPO3.Severity` object has been moved to `top.TYPO3.Severity`. Use `top.TYPO3.Severity.*` instead.
