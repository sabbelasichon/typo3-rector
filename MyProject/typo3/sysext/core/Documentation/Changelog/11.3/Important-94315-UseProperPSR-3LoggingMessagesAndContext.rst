=================================================================
Important: #94315 - Use proper PSR-3 logging messages and context
=================================================================

See :issue:`94315`

Description
===========

The v11 Core is looking into proper PSR-3 Logging implementation again. When
analyzing the current situation, we realized many Core logging calls were
using messages that violated the PSR-3
`placeholder specification <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/>`__.

The v11 Core fixed all places, but it's likely extensions have this issue,
too. Extension developers should have a look at their logger calls and adapt
them if necessary.

Typical call before:

.. code-block:: php

   $this->logger->alert(
      'Password reset requested for email "' .
      $emailAddress . '" . but was requested too many times.'
   );

Correct call:

.. code-block:: php

   $this->logger->alert(
      'Password reset requested for email {email} but was requested too many times.',
      ['email' => $emailAddress]
   );

First argument is :php:`message`, second (optional) argument is :php:`context`.
A message can use :php:`{placeholders}`.

All Core provided log writers will substitute placeholders in the message
with data from the context array, if a context array key with same name exists.
