Breaking: #66754 - Remove RenderingContextAwareInterface
========================================================

See :issue:`66754`

Description
===========

The `RenderingContextAwareInterface` allowed objects to get the `RenderingContext` set while being
accessed from inside a Fluid template. This makes optimization of variable access in Fluid difficult
and seems to be an unused feature. Therefore it has been removed.

Impact
======

For implementations of `RenderingContextAwareInterface` the change breaks without any simple replacement.
Functionality would have to be replicated in userland code. But as there are no known implementations
the expected impact is rather low.
