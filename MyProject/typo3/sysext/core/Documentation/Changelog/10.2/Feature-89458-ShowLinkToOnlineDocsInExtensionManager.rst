===============================================================
Feature: #89458 - Show link to online docs in extension manager
===============================================================

See :issue:`89458`

Description
===========

The export of extensions provided by https://extensions.typo3.org has been extended with the link
to the documentation of an extension. This link is now shown in all lists of extensions as well
as the detail view of extensions in the extension manager.

It is recommended that extension authors add documentation for their extensions on docs.typo3.org.

However, if an extension provides an external documentation source, the custom link takes precedence
over any existing documentation at docs.typo3.org.

Impact
======

Extension documentation links are now available in the extension manager.
