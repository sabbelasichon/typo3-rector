Breaking: #82398 - Remove special constant "TSConstantEditor"
=============================================================

See :issue:`82398`

Description
===========

The special functionality on the top level constant name :typoscript:`TSConstantEditor`
has been dropped. This rarely used feature makes this constant name a casual
constant without further added features.

A series of PHP class methods and properties has been dropped together with that removal:

* Method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\TypoScript\ConfigurationForm->ext_makeHelpInformationForCategory()`
* Method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\TypoScript\ConfigurationForm->ext_displayExample()`
* Method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\TypoScript\ExtendedTemplateService->ext_getTSCE_config()`
* Property :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\TypoScript\ExtendedTemplateService->helpConfig`
* Method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Domain\Model\ConfigurationCategory->setHighlightText()`
* Method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Domain\Model\ConfigurationCategory->getHighlightText()`
* Method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Domain\Model\ConfigurationItem->setHighlight()`
* Method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Domain\Model\ConfigurationItem->getHighlight()`

Impact
======

The constants editor does not show any extending information (like bulletpoints) for a constant
anymore configured via the :typoscript:`TSConstantEditor` object.


Affected Installations
======================

All installations which have configured the special constant :typoscript:`TSConstantEditor`. Since this has
been a widely unknown feature, most instances should not be affected. On PHP side, the extension
scanner will find consuming extensions of the dropped API, but that is highly unlikely, too.
