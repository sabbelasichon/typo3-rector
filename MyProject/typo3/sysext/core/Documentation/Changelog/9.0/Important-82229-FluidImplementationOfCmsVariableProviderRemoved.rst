Important: #82229 - Fluid implementation of CmsVariableProvider removed
=======================================================================

See :issue:`82229`

Description
===========

The PHP class within EXT:fluid named :php:`CmsVariableProvider` was removed. The custom functionality
is available in its parent class :php:`TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\Variables\StandardVariableProvider` from
Fluid standalone can be implemented directly.

Instantiating the removed class will still work through the functionality of class aliases in PHP,
however, using the parent class is encouraged.
