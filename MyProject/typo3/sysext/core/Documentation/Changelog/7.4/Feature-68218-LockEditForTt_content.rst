==========================================
Feature: #68218 - Lock edit for tt_content
==========================================

See :issue:`68218`

Description
===========

Content elements can now be restricted to be editable by admins only on a per record base. This has already been
possible for pages with the checkbox "Restrict editing by non-Admins".


Impact
======

This is useful to generally allow editors to edit content but be able to assure that important elements like the
imprint or specific plugins are not changed.
