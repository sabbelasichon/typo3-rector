=========================================
Feature: #67662 - DataProcessor for files
=========================================

See :issue:`67662`

Description
===========

A new Files DataProcessor has been introduced, which can be used to prepare data to be handled by a ContentObject
implementing the processors, e.g. the FLUIDTEMPLATE ContentObject. The FilesProcessor resolves File References, Files,
or Files inside a folder or collection to be used for output in the Frontend. A FLUIDTEMPLATE can then simply iterate
over processed data automatically.


.. code-block:: typoscript

	tt_content.image.20 = FLUIDTEMPLATE
	tt_content.image.20 {
		file = EXT:myextension/Resources/Private/Templates/ContentObjects/Image.html

		dataProcessing.10 = TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\DataProcessing\FilesProcessor
		dataProcessing.10 {
			# the field name where relations are set
			# + stdWrap
			references.fieldName = image

			# the table name where relations are put, defaults to the currently selected record from $cObj->getTable()
			# + stdWrap
			references.table = tt_content

			# A list of sys_file UID records
			# + stdWrap
			files = 21,42

			# A list of File Collection UID records
			# + stdWrap
			collections = 13,14

			# A list of FAL Folder identifiers and files fetched recursive from all folders
			# + stdWrap
			folders = 1:introduction/images/,1:introduction/posters/
			folders.recursive = 1

			# Property of which the files should be sorted after they have been accumulated
			# can be any property of sys_file, sys_file_metadata
			# + stdWrap
			sorting = description

			# Can be "ascending", "descending" or "random", defaults to "ascending" if none given
			# + stdWrap
			sorting.direction = descending

			# The target variable to be handed to the ContentObject again, can be used
			# in Fluid e.g. to iterate over the objects. defaults to "files" when not defined
			# + stdWrap
			as = myfiles
		}
	}

In the Fluid template then iterate over the files:

.. code-block:: html

	<ul>
	<f:for each="{myfiles}" as="file">
		<li><a href="{file.publicUrl}">{file.name}</a></li>
	</f:for>
	</ul>
