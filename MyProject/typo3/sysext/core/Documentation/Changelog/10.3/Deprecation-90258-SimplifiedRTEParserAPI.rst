===============================================
Deprecation: #90258 - Simplified RTE Parser API
===============================================

See :issue:`90258`

Description
===========

The PHP class :php:`RteHtmlParser` which is used to transform RTE-based
textarea fields from the database to the configured Rich Text Editor, and back, has a new simplified API.

For this reason, the following two methods have been marked as deprecated:

* :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser->init()`
* :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser->RTE_transform()`


Impact
======

Calling any of the methods will trigger a PHP :php:`E_USER_DEPRECATED` error.


Affected Installations
======================

TYPO3 installations with extensions dealing with extracting or adding content such as "l10nmgr", or any custom extension using
the methods.


Migration
=========

The method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser->init()` can be removed without substitution, as it
serves no purpose anymore.

The method :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Html\RteHtmlParser->RTE_transform()` now has two methods as substitute,
depending on the direction which is necessary. This was previously
done in the third method argument ("rte" and "db"):

- :php:`transformTextForRichTextEditor($content, $configuration)`
- :php:`transformTextForPersistence($content, $configuration)`

The second argument :php:`$configuration` is now the `processing` configuration (`proc`) of the RTE configuration.
