===============================
Feature: #89929 - Galician flag
===============================

See :issue:`89929`

Description
===========

When adding a new language to a site or the system (`sys_language`) the Galician flag (ISO-639-1 Code "gl") is now available for selection.


Impact
======

A previous error, where the flag for Greenlandic was available (ISO Code "kl") under the "GL" shortcut, was resolved with this feature,
as both flags now represent the proper ISO code.
