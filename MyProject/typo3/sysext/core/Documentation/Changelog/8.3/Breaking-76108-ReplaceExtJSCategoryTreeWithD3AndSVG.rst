Breaking: #76108 - Replace ExtJS category tree with D3 and SVG
==============================================================

See :issue:`76108`

Description
===========

Backend ExtJS category tree has been replaced with one based on D3.js and SVG.
The js file :file:`typo3/sysext/backend/Resources/Public/JavaScript/tree.js` has been removed.

The expanded/collapsed state will not be saved to the backend user settings any more.
It was not used in the core, as all category trees have setting `expandAll` set to `true`.
It also polluted backend user settings with tons of data without giving much usability gain.

Impact
======

Any JS code referencing ExtJS component :js:`TYPO3.Components.Tree` or its sub-components
(like :js:`TYPO3.Components.Tree.StandardTree`) will no longer work.


Affected Installations
======================

All installations having extensions which modify the :js:`TYPO3.Components.Tree`
(implemented in :file:`typo3/sysext/backend/Resources/Public/JavaScript/tree.js`) component,
or rely on the file being present.


Migration
=========

Migration of the JS code to the new `SvgTree` component is recommended.
