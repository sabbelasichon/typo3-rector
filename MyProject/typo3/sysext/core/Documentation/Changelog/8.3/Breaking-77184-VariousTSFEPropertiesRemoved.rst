==================================================
Breaking: #77184 - Various TSFE properties removed
==================================================

See :issue:`77184`

Description
===========

The following public properties of the PHP class :php:`TypoScriptFrontendController` have been removed.

* :php:`TYPO3_CONF_VARS`
* :php:`defaultBodyTag`
* :php:`clientInfo`

Additionally, the first parameter of the :php:`TypoScriptFrontendController` constructor has no effect anymore and can be set
to null.


Impact
======

Accessing or setting the properties will throw a PHP warning and have no effect anymore.


Affected Installations
======================

Any installation working with the public property in a third-party extension or instantiating the `TSFE` object itself.


Migration
=========

For any calls to :php:`$GLOBALS['TSFE']->TYPO3_CONF_VARS` the global array :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']` should be used.

For the property :php:`defaultBodyTag` the according TypoScript settings can be used to override the
body tag or the page title.

The information previously stored in the clientInfo property can be fetched via :php:`GeneralUtility::clientInfo()`.
