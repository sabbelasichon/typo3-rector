=======================================================
Breaking: #77558 - PageLayoutController removed methods
=======================================================

See :issue:`77558`

Description
===========

The following methods have been removed from :php:`PageLayoutController` without substitution:

* :php:`exec_languageQuery()`
* :php:`isColumnEmpty()`
* :php:`getElementsFromColumnAndLanguage()`

All of those methods were internally used within the Page module, the risk that an extension using them is low.

Impact
======

The methods executed page module specific queries. Extensions calling the method will throw a fatal error.


Affected Installations
======================

Extensions calling one of the aforementioned methods.


Migration
=========

Move away from those methods.
