===============================================
Breaking: #77391 - DataHandler method protected
===============================================

See :issue:`77391`

Description
===========

Method :php:`doesRecordExist_pageLookUp()` of class :php:`DataHandler` has been
changed from public access to protected access and the returned object changed to an
instance of :php:`QueryBuilder`.


Impact
======

Calling the method will trigger a fatal PHP error.


Affected Installations
======================

Extensions that use method :php:`doesRecordExist_pageLookUp()`. This is very unlikely
since the method is mostly only useful for core internal handling.


Migration
=========

No migration possible, remove the method call.
