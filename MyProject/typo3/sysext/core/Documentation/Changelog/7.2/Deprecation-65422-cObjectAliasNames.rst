============================================================
Deprecation: #65422 - Alias cObjects COBJ_ARRAY and CASEFUNC
============================================================

See :issue:`65422`

Description
===========

The cObject aliases `COBJ_ARRAY` (alias for `COA`) and `CASEFUNC` (alias for `CASE`) have been moved to the compatibility6 extension.
The use of these aliases have been marked for deprecation.


Impact
======

Any usage of TypoScript using `COBJ_ARRAY` and `CASEFUNC` will not work anymore unless the compatibility6 extension is
installed.


Affected installations
======================

All installations with TypoScript in `COBJ_ARRAY` and `CASEFUNC`.


Migration
=========

Use `COA` instead of `COBJ_ARRAY` and `CASE` instead of `CASEFUNC` in all TypoScript code.
Installing ext:compatibility6 can be used as a short-term solution, although this is discouraged.
