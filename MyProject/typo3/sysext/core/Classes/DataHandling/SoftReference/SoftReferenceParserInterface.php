 * is an example of this.
 * This interface defines the "parse" method, which parsers have to implement.
 * TYPO3 has already implemented parsers for the most well-known types. Soft Reference Parsers can also be user-defined.
 * The Soft Reference Parsers are used by the system to find these references and process them accordingly in import/export actions and copy operations.
