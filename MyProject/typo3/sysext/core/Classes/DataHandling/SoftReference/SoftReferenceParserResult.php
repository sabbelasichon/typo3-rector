/**
 * The result object has two properties: "content" and matched elements.
 *
 * content:
 * Is a string containing the input content but possibly with tokens inside.
 * Tokens are strings like {softref:[tokenID]}, which is a placeholder for a value extracted by a softref parser.
 * For each token there MUST be an entry in the "elements" key, which has a "subst" key defining the tokenID and the tokenValue. See below.
 *
 * matched elements:
 * is an array where the keys are insignificant, but the values are arrays with these keys:
 * "matchString" => // The value of the match. This is only for informational purposes to show what was found.
 * "error"       => // An error message can be set here, like "file not found" etc.
 * "subst"       => [ // If this array is found there MUST be a token in the output content as well!
 *     "tokenID"     => // The tokenID string corresponding to the token in output content, {softref:[tokenID]}. This is typically an md5 hash of a string defining uniquely the position of the element.
 *     "tokenValue"  => // The value that the token substitutes in the text. Basically, if this value is inserted instead of the token the content should match what was inputted originally.
 *     "type"        => // file / db / string = the type of substitution. "file" means it is a relative file [automatically mapped], "db" means a database record reference [automatically mapped], "string" means it is manually modified string content (eg. an email address)
 *     "relFileName" => // (for "file" type): Relative filename. May not necessarily exist. This could be noticed in the error key.
 *     "recordRef"   => // (for "db" type) : Reference to DB record on the form [table]:[uid]. May not necessarily exist.
 *     "title"       => // Title of element (for backend information)
 *     "description" => // Description of element (for backend information)
 * ]
