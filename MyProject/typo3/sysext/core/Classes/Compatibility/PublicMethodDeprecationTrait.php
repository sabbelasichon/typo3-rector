/**
 * Trait to support the logging of deprecation of public INSTANCE methods.
 *
 * This is useful due to the long list of PHP4 methods that have been set to
 * public previously, which should be removed or moved to "protected" / "private".
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * 1. Use this trait for the class with the method to change the visibility status or to be removed.
 * 2. Add the class methods with deprecated public visibility to $deprecatedPublicMethods.
 * 3. Set these methods to protected or private.
 * 4. Add the phpDoc tag "@private" to the method so IDEs understand that.
 *
 * With the next major release remove the "@private" tag and remove the methods from
 * $deprecatedPublicMethods. Remove the trait use after removing the last deprecation.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * - Only use this trait in classes only that do not define their own magic __call() method.
 * - Do not use this trait for static methods.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *
 * class MyControllerClass {
 *     use PublicMethodDeprecationTrait;
 *
 *     /**
 *       * List previously publicly accessible variables
 *       * @var array
 *       *...
 *     private $deprecatedPublicMethods = [
 *         'myMethod' => 'Using MyControllerClass::myMethod() is deprecated and will not be possible anymore in TYPO3 v10.0. Use MyControllerClass:myOtherMethod() instead.'
 *     ];
 *
 *     /**
 *      * This is my method.
 *      *
 *      * @deprecated (if deprecated)
 *      * @internal (if switched to private)
 *      /
 *     protected function myMethod($arg1, $arg2);
 * }
 */

 * This trait has no public methods by default, ensure to add a $deprecatedPublicMethods property
