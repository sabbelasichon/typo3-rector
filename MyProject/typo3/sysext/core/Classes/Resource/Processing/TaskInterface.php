/**
 * A task is a unit of work that can be performed by a file processor. This may include multiple steps in any order,
 * details depend on the configuration of the task and the tools the processor uses.
 *
 * Each task has a type and a name. The type describes the category of the task, like "image" and "video". If your task
 * is generic or applies to multiple types of files, use "general".
 *
 * A task also already has to know the target file it should be executed on, so there is no "abstract" task that just
 * specifies the steps to be executed without a concrete file. However, new tasks can easily be created from an
 * existing task object.
