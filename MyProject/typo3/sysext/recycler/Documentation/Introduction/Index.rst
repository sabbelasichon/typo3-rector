When a record is deleted in the TYPO3 backend, it is marked for deletion in
the database and not visible anymore in the backend or displayed on the website.

In the Recycler module you can restore or delete "soft-deleted" data. The
backend module provides an overview of the relevant records, allows filtering
of results or executing required actions.

This feature is originally based on the kj\_recycler extension,
developed by Julian Kleinhans.
