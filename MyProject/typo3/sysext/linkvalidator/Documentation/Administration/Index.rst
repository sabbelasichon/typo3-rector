The LinkValidator is a tool for checking link in user input. It is part of the
system extension :file:`linkvalidator`.

If you are using Composer, you can install it like any other (Core) extension
requiring the package `typo3/cms-linkvalidator`:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require typo3/cms-linkvalidator

If you want to use the LinkValidator in the Scheduler, the system extension
:file:`scheduler` also needs to be installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require typo3/cms-scheduler

If you are not using Composer, you may have to activate the LinkValidator in
the Extension Manager.

LinkValidator uses the HTTP request library shipped with TYPO3.
Please have a look in the :ref:`Global Configuration <t3coreapi:typo3ConfVars>`,
particularly at the HTTP settings.

There, you may define a default timeout. Generally, it is recommended
to always specify timeouts when working with the LinkValidator.
