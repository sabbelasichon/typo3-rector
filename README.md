# Rector for TYPO3

This project lets you apply instant upgrades and refactoring to your [TYPO3 Website](https://get.typo3.org/) and
[extension](https://extensions.typo3.org) code, making it easier to migrate between TYPO3 releases and keeping your code
free from deprecation.

It extends the [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) project, which aims to provide instant upgrades and refactoring for any PHP code (5.3+).

> [!WARNING]
> :heavy_exclamation_mark: Never run this tool on production! Always run it on development environment where code is under version control (e.g. git).
> Review and test changes before releasing to production. Code migrations could potentionally break your website!

## Known Drawbacks

### How to Apply Coding Standards?

Rector uses [nikic/php-parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/), built on technology called an
*abstract syntax tree* (AST). An AST doesn't know about spaces and when written to a file it produces poorly formatted
code in both PHP and docblock annotations. **That's why your project needs to have a coding standard tool** and a set of
formatting rules, so it can make Rector's output code nice and shiny again.

We're using [ECS](https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard) with [this setup](ecs.php).
