####
# Due to some Github Actions limitations, we are running realtime fixes (commits) only for self-owned-pr
#
# Current limitations:
# - Secrets (ACCESS_TOKEN) are not available in PRs from forks
# - Github Token has Read-only access (can not commit), Personal Access Token must be used instead
# - Github Token does not trigger workflows after push
#
# So we basically have chicken-egg problem here
